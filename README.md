## TASK 1: SOFTWARE CONFIGURATION

### Subtask 1: Why did I choose to participate in the portfolio challenge?

I am a manual software tester with more than one year of commercial experience. 

I love challenges and **learning by doing**. I enjoy learning in a group and gaining knowledge from others by **finding solutions together**. 

I would like to expand my knowledge of automated testing and Python.
